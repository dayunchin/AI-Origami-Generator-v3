‚ú® Features
The application is split into two main modes: a start screen for image generation/selection and a powerful single-image editor.
üé® Creative Suite
Text-to-Image Generation: Create beautiful, high-quality images of origami concepts from a simple text prompt.
Prompt Builder: An interactive assistant on the start screen helps you craft the perfect prompt by selecting from categories like Origami Type, Shape, Color, Style, and more.
Prompt History: Your recent text-to-image prompts are saved locally for easy reuse.
Image Variations: Generate multiple creative variations from a single image or prompt.
Generate Animation: Create a short, looping 360-degree rotation animation (MP4 video) from your image.
üõ†Ô∏è AI-Powered Editing Suite
AI Suggestions: The editor analyzes your uploaded image and provides one-click enhancement suggestions.
Magic Edit: Perform precise, localized edits. Simply click a point on the image and describe the change (e.g., "change the color to blue").
Lasso Select: Draw a free-form selection around an area and describe the changes you want to make only within that region.
Style Transfer: Apply the complete artistic style (colors, textures, mood) of one image onto another.
Remove Background: Automatically identifies the main subject and removes the background, creating a transparent PNG.
Generative Expand (Outpainting): Expand the canvas of your image and let AI seamlessly fill in the new areas, with optional text prompts for context.
AI Upscale: Increase the image resolution by 2x while intelligently enhancing details and sharpness.
Presets: Save a sequence of edits as a custom preset and apply your entire workflow to other images with a single click.
üì∑ Standard Editing Tools
Adjustments: Apply professional adjustments like blurring the background, enhancing details, applying warmer lighting, or completely replacing the background with a new scene described by a prompt.
Filters: A wide range of one-click artistic filters (Synthwave, Anime, Noir, etc.) and the ability to describe your own custom filter.
Crop: Standard image cropping with aspect ratio presets (Square, 16:9).
Undo/Redo/Reset: Full history control over your editing session.
Comparison Slider: A draggable slider to compare your current edit with the original image in real-time.
üåê Other Features
Batch Editor: Apply a single filter or adjustment to multiple images at once and download them as a .zip file.
Multi-language Support: The user interface can be translated into multiple languages on the fly.
Fully Responsive: A seamless experience on both desktop and mobile devices.
