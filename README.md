‚ú®** Features**
The application is split into three main modes: Text/Prompt-to-Image generation, Image-to-Image selection with a powerful single-image editor, and a Batch Editor for editing multiple generated or uploaded origami images.

**Text/Prompt-to-Image Generation: **Create beautiful, high-quality images of origami concepts from text or prompts generated by other AI tools.
Prompt Builder: An interactive assistant on the start screen helps you craft the perfect prompt by offering text suggestions such as Origami Type, Shape, Color, Style, and more.
Prompt History: Your recent text-to-image prompts are saved locally for easy reuse.

**Image-to-Image Generation:** Create beautiful, high-quality images of origami concepts from images generated by AI or uploaded by you.

üõ†Ô∏è Single-Image Editor- An AI-powered editing suite to edit or enhance origami images. Sometimes AI origami outputs contain more than one design in a single image; making adjustments can ease the process of folding the actual physical origami model.
