‚ú® Features
The application is split into three main modes: Text/Prompt-to-Image generation, Image-to-Image selection with a powerful single-image editor, and a Batch Editor for editing multiple generated or uploaded origami images.

Text/Prompt-to-Image Generation: Create beautiful, high-quality images of origami concepts from text or prompts generated by other AI tools.
Prompt Builder: An interactive assistant on the start screen helps you craft the perfect prompt by offering text suggestions such as Origami Type, Shape, Color, Style, and more.
Prompt History: Your recent text-to-image prompts are saved locally for easy reuse.

Image-to-Image Generation: Create beautiful, high-quality images of origami concepts from images generated by AI or uploaded by you.

üõ†Ô∏è Single-Image Editor- An AI-powered editing suite to edit or enhance origami images. Sometimes AI origami outputs contain more than one design in a single image; making adjustments can ease the process of folding the actual physical origami model.

2/ Magic Edit: Perform precise, localized edits. Simply click a point on the image and describe the change (e.g., "change the color to blue").

4/ Style Transfer: Apply the complete artistic style (colors, textures, mood) of one image onto another.
5/ Remove Background: Automatically identifies the main subject and removes the background, creating a transparent PNG.
6/ Generative Expand (Outpainting): Expand the canvas of your image and let AI seamlessly fill in the new areas, with optional text prompts for context.
7/ AI Upscale: Increase the image resolution by 2x while intelligently enhancing details and sharpness.
8/ Presets: Save a sequence of edits as a custom preset and apply your entire workflow to other images with a single click.
9/ Standard Editing Tools
A. Adjustments: Apply professional adjustments like blurring the background, enhancing details, applying warmer lighting, or completely replacing the background with a new scene described by a prompt.
B. Filters: A wide range of one-click artistic filters (Synthwave, Anime, Noir, etc.) and the ability to describe your own custom filter.
C. Crop: Standard image cropping with aspect ratio presets (Square, 16:9).
D. Undo/Redo/Reset: Full history control over your editing session.
E. Comparison Slider: A draggable slider to compare your current edit with the original image in real-time.
10/ Image Variations: Generate multiple creative variations from a single image or prompt.
11/ Generate Animation: Create a short, looping 360-degree rotation animation (MP4 video) from your image.
